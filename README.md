FoolsGold 💰⛓️

A simple blockchain experiment for learning and testing cryptographic concepts.

📌 About

FoolsGold is a learning project designed to explore the fundamentals of blockchain technology, including:

- 🔗 Blockchain structure – Blocks, transactions, and hashing
- 🔐 Cryptographic principles – SHA-256, proof-of-work, and digital signatures
- ⛏️ Mining simulation – Basic proof-of-work implementation
-📜 Ledger functionality – Recording and verifying transactions

This project is not intended for real-world use but rather as a hands-on way to understand blockchain mechanics in Python.


⚙️ Features

- ✅ Block structure with timestamp, previous hash, and proof-of-work
- ✅ Simple transaction model for adding data to blocks
- ✅ SHA-256 hashing for integrity and security
- ✅ Basic proof-of-work algorithm to validate new blocks
- ✅ Chain validation to ensure immutability


🚀 Installation & Usage

- 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdrianoGoede/FoolsGold.git
cd FoolsGold
```
2️⃣ Install Dependencies (if any required)
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3️⃣ Run the Blockchain Simulation
```sh
python main.py
```

🛠️ Planned Improvements
- Implement digital signatures for secure transactions
- Add a basic peer-to-peer network for block sharing
- Improve proof-of-work algorithm for better difficulty adjustment
- Create a simple API for interacting with the blockchain
